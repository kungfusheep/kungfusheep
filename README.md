# 👋 Hey, I’m Pete

I design and build high-performance systems, products, dev tools, and UI frameworks; with a bias for simplicity, speed, and control. Ex-bet365, currently Director of Architecture at Happening/Superbet. 

- 🛠️ Working on [Glint](https://github.com/kungfusheep/glint) — a binary format focused on performance and clarity
- ⚡ Wrote [JinGo](https://github.com/bet365/jingo), one of the fastest JSON encoders for Go
- 🧠 Interested in performance, user experience, agentic tooling, serialization, canvas-based UI, and software that’s easy to change, release, test & delete.
